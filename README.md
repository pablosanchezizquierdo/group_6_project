## Data Retrieval:

The data used for this project was found in the Microbial Biodegradation of Persistent Organic Pollutants Database (mibPOPdb) developed by Houjin Zhang's group and published in the article "mibPOPdb: An online database for microbial biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants".

To retrieve the data, you should do the following:

1.  Access [Tanyaradzwa, Peiji et. al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1002/imt2.45).
2.  From the article, you can access the mibPOPdb official website, or click directly in the following link: [mibPOPdb](http://mibpop.genome-mining.cn/index/).
3.  Once in the website, find the "Download Data" tab in the blue menu in the left hand side of your screen.
4.  Download both the "Genes" and "Sequences" zip folders and place them in data/\_raw folder once you have run the code for "Creating Directories" in the "00_all.qmd" file. (NOTE:You don't need to unzip anything before uploading the folders)
