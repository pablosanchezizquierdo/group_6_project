```{r}
# Prepare the data (you may need to adjust this step based on your actual dataset structure)
data_for_plot <- data_augmented %>%
  count(`Compound Name`, Pathway_Info) %>%
  group_by(`Compound Name`) %>%
  mutate(Proportion = n / sum(n))

# Create the stacked bar chart

  geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Pathways for Each Compound",
       x = "Compound",
       y = "Proportion")
